You have an absolute right to opt-out of direct marketing, or profiling we carry out for direct marketing, at any time. You can do this by following the instructions in the communication within an electronic message, or by contacting us at polkassembly@parity.io.\n\nWho will we share this data with, where and when\n\n- **Vendors and service providers**. We will share your personal data with third party service providers who support our business, who will process it on behalf of Parity for the purposes identified above. Such third parties include providers of hosting services and technical infrastructure including browser extension developers, blockchain infrastructure providers, third party account management services, customer support services, and marketing services.\n- **Third party direct communication and marketing services.** We will share your email address with third party service providers to send direct marketing emails on our behalf with your consent.\n- **Parity group companies**. We may share your information with our group of companies for the purposes of business administration, maintaining security and regulatory compliance, providing support services to end users (including IT support, where relevant), marketing and analytics.\n- **Legal reasons**. We will share personal information outside of Parity if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to (i)  enforce applicable terms of service or other agreements, including investigation of potential violations and audits, (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, abuse, security risks, or technical issues, and (iii) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Parity, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.\n- **Business transfers**. In the event that Parity undergoes any reorganisation, restructuring, merger, sale, or other transfer of assets your information will be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchaser&#39;s adviser and will be passed to any new owners of the business.\n\nIn connection with the purposes identified above, your personal data will be shared in the UK and EEA, and may be transferred outside the UK and the EEA . Where information is transferred outside the UK or EEA that is not subject to an adequacy decision by the EU Commission, data is adequately protected by EU Commission approved standard contractual clauses, an appropriate Privacy Shield certification or a vendor&#39;s Processor Binding Corporate Rules.\n\n## What rights do I have?\n\nWhere required by applicable law or regulation, you have the right to **ask us for a copy** of your personal data; to **correct** , **delete** or **restrict** (stop any active) processing of your personal data; and to **obtain the personal data you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format** , and to ask us to **share (port) this data to another controller.** If you are a registered user of the Forum, you may also review and change your personal information on your account profile page.\n\nIn addition, you can **object to the processing** of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don&#39;t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the data for direct marketing). These **rights may be limited** , for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make.\n\nTo exercise any of these rights - or get a copy of our legitimate interest balancing tests -  you can get in touch with us using the details set out below. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the **right to complain** to a data protection authority where you live, work or where you believe a breach may have occurred.\n\nFor the provision of information marked as mandatory when you register to use the Forum, if such information is not provided, then you will not be able to use the Forum. All other provision of your information is optional. If you do not provide such information, our provision of certain services to you may be detracted from.\n\n## How long will you retain my data?\n\nWe store data for as long as necessary to provide our services. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. Some personal data you can delete whenever you like, some data is deleted automatically, and some data we retain for longer periods of time. For example:\n\n- We will keep the account information you provide to us for as long as you remain an account holder.\n- We will keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing indefinitely, so that we can respect your request in future.\n- We will keep usage information and analytics data for a reasonable length of time that allows us to provide our services and to understand how people use the Forum.\n\nSometimes business and legal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, for an extended period of time. Reasons we might retain some data for longer periods of time include security, fraud prevention, financial record-keeping, complying with legal or regulatory requirements, ensuring the continuity of our services, and when there have been direct communications with Parity.\n\n## How do I get in touch with you?\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns about how we process your data, please contact us at legal@parity.io.\n\n## Who is my data controller?\n\nAny personal information provided to or gathered by Parity is controlled by Parity Technologies Limited.For more information on who is considered the specific data controller in connection with the collection of your personal information please contact us at legal@parity.io.\n\n## Changes to our privacy notice\n\nWe reserve the right to change this privacy notice from time to time to reflect changes in the law or regulation, our information practices, our services, or our operational requirements. Depending on the type of change, we may notify you by updating this page or by email. We encourage you to periodically review this page to see any changes we have made.\n\nLast updated: 19th February 2020 version 1`;","// Copyright 2019-2020 @paritytech/polkassembly authors & contributors\n// This software may be modified and distributed under the terms\n// of the Apache-2.0 license.

Changes to these Terms\n\n  1.  We may make changes to these terms from time to time (if, for example, there is a change in the law that means we need to change these Terms). We will give you at least thirty days' advance notice of such changes. If you do not wish to continue using the Forum following the changes, you can cancel your agreement to these Terms by cancelling your Account. Your continued use of the Forum following the prior notification of the amended terms will be understood as your acceptance of the new terms.\n\n## 9.  Other important information\n  1.
